# Code Reviews and Pull Request Workshop

Welcome!
In this Workshop we will be exploring Github Pull Request.
Pull Requests are one of Githubs main communication mechanismos between developers and the thirds tab in importance (after Code :-) and Issues).

# Before the Workshop

Please compleate the following tasks *before* the day of the workshop. 

1) Get aquianinted with the Workshop content by reading and compleating **[Github Skills Review Pull Requests tutorial](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)**
2) Check your understanding with this brief [quizz](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/).

# At the Workshop

1) Clone this repository
**Note**: This repository contains an Eclipse 2022 Java Project. If you are using another IDE, you might need to download the code and create your own repository to complete the excercise.
2) Familiarise yourself with the code.
* Does it compile?
* Do the test run?
* Do the test pass?
* Can you state in one tweet what is the purpose of this code?
3) Review the code. 
 When reviewing the code, pay attention to:
 - Is the code style correct?
 - Is th code readable?
 - Are there any unecessary complexities in the code?
 - Is the code design reasonable?
 - Are the unit test comprehensive?
Or anything else you can think would improve the code.
4) Do you have anything to recommend to the author?
*Note*: I trust that you do :-)
Create a Pull Request and assign my user (@smatalonga) as the reviewer of the Pull Request.


# After the Workshop
The following are interesting links to compleate and complement your understanding and the  discussions during the class.
* [What to look for in a code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html)
* [Dave Farley. Why Pull Requests are a bad idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASOSEiJCyEM)

The code in the workshop is inspired in "The Money Example" introduced in Kent Beck's book "Test Driven Development by Example" ([Amazon Link](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Test-Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321146530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GIHWM03N5FZP&keywords=Tdd+by+example+kent+beck&qid=1669377197&sprefix=tdd+by+example+kent+beck%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1).
